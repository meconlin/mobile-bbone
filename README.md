#### Mobile bbone 

This is a simple backbone application being used for a learning exercise

#### Running it locally

I like to use Python
```
<project dir>/python -mSimpleHTTPServer
```

#### TODO 

- header needs navigation/controls
- post a reply
- post a comment
- post user settings, including pic?
- bower, grunt, karma this up  
- unit tests
- consider requirejs for improved packaging ?
- consider backbone.validate for cleaner validation ?
- consider backbone.localstorage for local caching ?
